**Key lessons learnt**

This was my first project incorporating HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT and overall I am pleased with the result. I learned about structure and how to build a project from idea to completion. 

**Take aways **
- Plan on paper, not just in your head.
- Slow down. Spelling mistakes are not ok. 
- Make clear comments - I asked my friend to take a look and he noticed a handfull of mistakes in the spelling. 
- label classes and ID's clearly
- DRY (don't repeat yourself)
