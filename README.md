**Palindrome Solver.**
This web page takes a text input and alerts the user if the text is or is not a pallindrome.

**Description**
I made this webpage to learn how to encorporate HTML, CSS and JS. 

**how it works **
1. The script firstly removes any unwanted characters (spaces, #@/.,) from the text input and converts it to lowercase. 
2. The string is then reversed using three functions (.split, .reverse and .join).
3. The reversed string is then compared to the orinigal string an alert box informs the user if their input is/is not a palindrome.
